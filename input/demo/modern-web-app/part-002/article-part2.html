<h2>Creating a Modern Web Application</h2>
<h1>Part 2 - Working with HTML5 and CSS3</h1>

<p>
This is Part 2 in a series on creating a web application utilizing modern 
techniques in order to deliver a fast, cohesive site.  The index for this series 
can be found at the end of <a href="#">part 1 in this series</a>.

<p>
As you can see on the left, we are starting out with a fairly simple 
file structure.  In order to keep things simple, we are going to assume 
that this is going to be run from the root of the website.
</p>

<p>
The first thing I'd like to do is point out the PIE.htc file in the 
root directory.  This comes from the CSS3PIE project and will be used 
to aid IE6-8 in rendering CSS3 features such as rounded borders and 
background gradients.  There isn't full support for every feature of 
CSS3, and there are a couple of quirks.  However, this is still a 
far better use of resources to work around these minor IEOLD issues 
rather than having the additional images and markup needed to do 
rounded corners and background gradients via other, more traditional 
methods.
</p>

<p>
Second, I'd like to point out that I'm starting off with two JavaScript
files in place.  The css_browser_selector.js adds specific classes to the 
HTML (documentElement) element in order to write clean CSS rules when possible. 
This functionality is only useful when JavaScript is enabled, so it should be 
used sparingly.  As IE is still the browser king, with several quirky variations 
on rendering, we'll also be adding in some conditional elements in order to target 
specific IE versions in our CSS.
</p>

<p>
At this point I am going to point out that I've defined three stylesheets.  I've 
created a general main.css as well as the addition of a main-ienew.css and 
main-ieold.css.  Where the ienew variant will be fore IE9+ and the ieold will
target IE6-8 specifically.  The main reason for this is because of some current 
quirkiness in IE9 beta where it will load PIE.htc behavior on elements despite 
being set not do to so. 
</p>

<pre>example: #ieold .className { behavior: url(/PIE.htc); }</pre>

<p>
In the prior example, the <code>#ieold</code> should only apply to IE versions 
prior to 9, however IE9 will still attempt to add the PIE behavior and break 
the rendering.  You can see an example of this <a href="">here</a>.  It turns 
out the bug wasn't with IE9's rounded corners with a background gradient, but 
that it applies the behavior to elements it shouldn't be.
</p>

<p>
At this point, I'm going to point out the actual markup of our starting page, then 
go over the CSS that will be in place to support this.  This is a demonstration 
of creating the rounded corners and background gradients only.  Other operations 
will be covered in future articles.
</p>

<pre>!!! TODO: Insert HEAD Content Here !!!</pre>

<p>
Above you see the content through the HEAD section of the document. 
We first start with the HTML5 DOCTYPE, which in essense tells the browser to 
use whatever the newest/current rendering engine available has to offer.  
Next we include some meta elements, the first of which <code>X-UA-Compatible</code>.
As of Internet Explorer version 8, the rendering engine for 7 and 8 are included, 
unfortunately IE6 is not.  I suggest using IE Tester, or a stand alone installer 
for older IE version testing.  The X-UA-Compatible meta attribute can set the 
IE renderer to be used and is set to 99 in our example to future-proof things. 
If you come across issues with IE9 or later, this can be helpful to force the 
older rendering until specific issues can be worked out.  You will also notice 
the <code>chrome=1</code> portion; which will tell IE browsers with the Chrome 
Frame plugin installed to utilize the Chrome rendering engine where available. 
I personally consider the Webkit rendering engine along with the V8 JavaScript 
engine the gold standard to view against.  This may change in the future, but 
for now, how it renders in Webkit (Chrome/Safari) should be considered how it 
*should* be rendering.  This will give you the least resistance in adjusting 
for non-compliant browsers.
</p>

<p>
After the typical meta elements for keywords, description and a link to the favicon. 
The regular TITLE element is encluded.  It's worth noting that within the TITLE element, 
you should have your specific section of the site first, followed by more generic 
information.  In this case, I'm starting with the specific page's name, followed 
by the title of the site/series.  This can help will SEO, as having the same 
content in every title delutes the value of that title across a site.
</p>

<p>
The first scripts we include are those that *must* be included in the head in 
order to function properly, and before any stylesheets are loaded.  This will 
reduce the impact of said scripts on the css that comes next.  After the main.css,
I am including some conditional scripts for IENEW and IEOLD, where IEOLD is 
anything prior to version 9 (our support target is 6-9), and IENEW is defined 
as anything from version 9 on (which supports HTML5).  After the general 
stylesheets we're including a css to establish print adjustments.  It's 
important to establish a print media stylesheet that reduces the additional clutter 
such as the header, footer and page margins in order for the printing experience 
to be better.
</p>

<p>On to the rest of the html file...</p>

<pre>!!! TODO: include body to close here</pre>

<p>
Within the BODY element, the first thing added is a number of DIV elements 
surrounded by IE's conditional comments.  These comments allow for the CSS to 
target a specific version of IE, or even a non IE browser without the need for 
JavaScript (as added by the css_browser_selector.js), which can improve the 
initial rendering.  It should be noted that we won't be avoiding javascript 
and progressive enhancement, but one should be mindful of the rendering of a 
page without JavaScript as this can help with visually impared users as well 
as the initial load impression of a given page/site.
</p>

<p>
Within the browser elements, we see some very semantic markup.  An ARTICLE element 
is a container, which has an HGROUP (Header Group) element followed by a DETAILS 
element.  The DETAILS element's first child is a SUMMARY element which contains the 
relative information regarding the rest of the DETAILS section.  This can be thought 
of as similar to the relationship of a LEGEND element inside of a FIELDSET.  Though 
the SUMMARY element is meant to be used as an inline element, we'll be displaying 
it as a block element.  These tags may seem very blog oriented, and in a way 
they are.  However, they do make for some very natural containers, as well as 
being far shorter than adding classnames to meaningless nested div tags.  There 
is also a SECTION element that's been added which can be used to contain multiple 
ARTICLE tags for example.  The use of these tags at a higher level allow for very 
simple CSS rules, and can minimize the risk of a conflict in structure for nested 
tags from external resources or controls down the road.
</p>

<p>
Finally we get into the .css files.  I'll be stepping through the relevant 
portions, though you'll be able to download the full demonstration as well as 
view the demo page online.
</p>

<pre>TODO: h2 and grid_4</pre>

<p>
First, I reset the margin/border/padding for Heading elements.  The next article 
will have a more complete reset css attached, along with some @font-face declarations 
to ensure a consistant rendering.  Next is the <code>.grid_4</code> declaration 
which will be replaced with a generated grid 12 css in the next article as well.
</p>

<pre>TODO: hgroup</pre>

<p>
Here is where we start digging into the meat of this article.  Within the HGROUP 
we specify the various implementations of <code>border-radius</code> as this 
attribute is only recently being formalized by the W3C, webkit (Chrome & Safari) 
and Mozilla (Firefox) browsers created their own vender specific css attributes, 
so we start with them.  They all follow the same format allowing you to specify 
each corner's value in a clockwise fashion starting with the TOP-LEFT position.
</p>

<p>
After the <code>border-radius</code> is defined, the background is then specified. 
How this is done is to first specify a background color that will be used as a 
fallback value.  After this, we specify the vendor specific implementations and 
finally fallback to a common CSS3 implementation.
</p>

<p>
You can find quite a bit of information on CSS gradients in this article.  It's 
worth noting that the linked article has a few things that are at least 
mis-represented in regards to IE9, I'll discuss these in more 
detail when we reach part 5 in this series.  For now I'll simply note that 
the -pie-background is required for the CSS3PIE implementation for IEOLD (6-8) 
and that the z-index for the grid_4 is also related to a quirk in using PIE.htc; 
I'll also be discussing the use of PIE further in part 5, which should be out 
next wednesday.  For now, I am including the necessary markup for IEOLD and 
IENEW if you want to dig into the .css files for the demo.
