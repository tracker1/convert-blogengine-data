  <title>Mapping windows volume for keyboards without media keys</title>
  <description />
  <content>&lt;p&gt;Okay, I've been using this for quite a while now, but figured it should be useful for those who aren't me.  I'm currently using a &lt;a href="http://www.pckeyboard.com/"&gt;Unicomp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://pckeyboards.stores.yahoo.net/customizer.html"&gt;Customizer 104&lt;/a&gt; key keyboard at work, and home.  These keyboards do not have media keys on them, which is fine since I rarely use anything other than the volume controls on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a program called &lt;a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/"&gt;AutoHotKey&lt;/a&gt; that can run scripts based on various keyboard inputs, or hotkey combinations.  I'm using the script below to match the Super/Windows key + [, ] and \ to volume down, up and mute respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;;; Map WIN + [ to Volume Down
#[::Send {Volume_Down 2}

;; Map WIN + ] to Volume Up
#]::Send {Volume_Up 2}

;; Map WIN + \ to toggle mute
#\::Send {Volume_Mute}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should state that I am not affiliated with either Unicomp or Autohotkey.  This is because it was helpful to me, and took a while to find this, and figured it would be helpful to others as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
