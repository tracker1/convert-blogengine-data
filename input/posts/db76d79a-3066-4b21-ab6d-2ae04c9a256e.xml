  <title>Site updates...</title>
  <description />
  <content>&lt;p&gt;Okay, I've updated the site to &lt;a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/"&gt;BlogEngine.net&lt;/a&gt; 1.5.&amp;nbsp; Beyond this i've gone through all the old posts adding a MORE tag, so that there's a tear from the main listing to the full post&amp;nbsp; From now on, only the newest post will be listed without the tear.&amp;nbsp; I've also updated all the older code samples to use a nice little script called &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/"&gt;SyntaxHighlighter&lt;/a&gt; (Okay, maybe not "little," but so worth it), far better than the tag&amp;nbsp; soup that was in there before, and degrades nicely for those with Javascript disabled (WHY?!?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've set the site to the *stock* theme for now, i'll try to get this modded soom.&amp;nbsp; Also, I'll be posting some updates to MySite soon, some more fun with ASP.Net MVC, Javascript goodies, and a special surprise are all in the works.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
