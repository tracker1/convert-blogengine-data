  <title>Intelectual Property Tax</title>
  <description />
  <content>&lt;p&gt;If intelectual property in this country is to be treated and protected like real property, then why isn't it taxed as real property.&amp;nbsp; Why aren't infringement settlements taxed at the point of transaction,the same as with physical goods?&amp;nbsp; If we are so short of funding for government programs, why isn't the copyright and patent industry taxed like the physical production industries?&lt;/p&gt;</content>
