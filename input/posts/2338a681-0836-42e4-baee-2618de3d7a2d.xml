  <title>AnkhSVN 2.0 Available</title>
  <description />
  <content>&lt;p&gt;Not sure how this snuck by me without notice, but the 2.0 release of &lt;a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/servlets/ProjectHome"&gt;Ankh SVN&lt;/a&gt; is out, and pretty much rocks.&amp;nbsp; It's now an SCC adapter, instead of a VS Plugin.&amp;nbsp; This means better VS integration.&amp;nbsp; Not to mention Diff and Merge now works as you would expect.&amp;nbsp; Worth the upgrade, uninstall your old version first.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
